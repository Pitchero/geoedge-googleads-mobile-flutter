# GeoEdge Google Ads Package

Forked from the official [google_mobile_ads](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads) package.

This repository customises the official package so that it can be used with the GeoEdge AppHarbr SDK for iOS and Android.
Please note that it doesn't fully implement the AppHarbr SDK, as it only covers GAM Banner Ads.

## Updating

To update the package, merge in changes from the official repository first before testing.
Please also tag this package with a version code in line with the official repo after any changes are made.
